# Covid 19 Data Analysis
In this project I did an analysis and visualization on the Covid 19 dataset.
The dataset is collected from this [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) and imported as a SQL Database where I used a couple of statements to select information that is supporting my analysis. The visualizations were created in Power BI connected to the SQL Database.

The complete description of the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/FilipeTheAnalyst/DataAnalystProject_SQL_PBI_Covid19/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Portfolio%20Project.docx).

The goal is to visualize relevant statistics regarding covid 19 cases and vaccinations since the beginning of 2020.

Here are the main metrics: total cases, deaths, population percentage infected by country/continent, death percentage.
